I want to create a to-do list application using TypeScript and TDD. The application must have the following characteristics:

- Allow adding a task to the list.

- Allow marking a task as completed.

- Allow to remove a task from the list.

- Show the list of tasks.

It should also use tests to test the app's functionality.

I must create a CLI to test the application's functionality.

# Step 1: Set up a TypeScript project

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Initialize a new TypeScript project by running the following command:

npm init -y

4. Install TypeScript as a development dependency by running:

npm install --save-dev typescript

5. Create a tsconfig.json file in the root of your project and add the following minimal configuration:

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es6",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": [
    "src"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}

6. Create a src directory in the project and a file named index.ts inside it. This will be your entry point for the application.


# Step 2: Install Jest and related dependencies

1. Install Jest as a development dependency by running:

npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest

2. Create a jest.config.js file in the project's root directory and add the following configuration:

module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  modulePathIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/dist/']
};


# Step 3: Write your first test

ATENTION, NO CODE YET AS I VE MADE THIS COPYPASTE AT THE BEGINNING FROM CHAT GPT

1. Create a tests directory in the project's root directory.
2. Inside the tests directory, create a file named todo.spec.ts.
3. Write a test case for your to-do list functionality. For example:

THIS IS ONLY A EXAMPLE!!


import { TodoList } from '../src/todo';

describe('TodoList', () => {
  let todoList: TodoList;

  beforeEach(() => {
    todoList = new TodoList();
  });

  test('should add a task to the list', () => {
    todoList.addTask('Buy groceries');
    expect(todoList.getTasks()).toContain('Buy groceries');
  });
});


# Step 4: Implement the application code

1. In the src directory, create a file named todo.ts.
2. Implement the TodoList class:

export class TodoList {
  private tasks: string[];

  constructor() {
    this.tasks = [];
  }

  addTask(task: string): void {
    this.tasks.push(task);
  }

  getTasks(): string[] {
    return this.tasks;
  }
}

# Step 5: Run the tests

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to execute the tests:

npm test

If all goes well, you should see the test passing. From here, you can continue writing more tests and implementing the rest of your to-do list application functionality using TDD principles.

Feel free to modify the file and directory names according to your preference. This is just a basic setup to help you get started. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

# instructions to create the folder

Based on the information you provided, I can guide you in setting up the folder structure for your to-do list project. Here's a recommended structure that aligns with common best practices:

Create the Project Directory:

Choose a suitable location on your computer and create a new directory for your project. You can name it something like "toDoList" or any other name of your preference.
Set Up the Folder Structure:

Inside the project directory, create the following folders:
src: This folder will contain your application's source code.
public: This folder will contain static files that will be served to the client.
Create Necessary Files:

Inside the src folder, create an entry point file, such as index.ts or main.ts, where your application's execution starts.
Additionally, you will need to create the necessary configuration files:
tsconfig.json: This file contains the TypeScript compiler configuration. You can refer to the TypeScript documentation or the previous guidance in this chat for an example configuration.
package.json: This file manages your project's dependencies and provides scripts for various tasks. You can create it by running npm init in the project directory and following the prompts.
After setting up the initial folder structure and creating the necessary files, you can continue developing your to-do list application within the src directory. The public directory can be used to store static assets like HTML, CSS, or images if you decide to build a web front-end later.

Remember to install the required dependencies by running npm install within the project directory. This will read the package.json file and install the dependencies listed there.

Feel free to adjust the folder and file names according to your preferences. The structure mentioned above provides a solid foundation for your project, allowing you to organize your code and assets effectively.

## further considerations for installing

    Inside the tests folder, create a test file, such as todoList.test.ts, where you can write your tests using Jest.

Initialize npm:

    Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
    Run the following command to initialize npm and create a package.json file:

npm init

    Follow the prompts to provide the necessary information or press Enter to accept the default values.

Install Jest:

    Run the following command to install Jest as a development dependency:

npm install --save-dev jest


Configure Jest:

    Create a jest.config.js file in the project root directory.
    Add the following content to the jest.config.js file:

module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  roots: ['tests'],
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.tsx?$': 'ts-jest',
  },
  testRegex: '\\.test\\.tsx?$',
  moduleFileExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'json', 'node'],
};

Update package.json:

    Open the package.json file and modify the "test" script to "jest":

"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
},
