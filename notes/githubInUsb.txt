Yes, it is possible to clone your GitHub repository to your USB stick and interact with your repository from there when you are at school. You do not necessarily need an SSH key specifically for your USB stick, but you will need to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to clone and interact with the repository from the school computer.

Here's how you can clone your GitHub repository to your USB stick:

Connect your USB stick to your personal computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory on your USB stick where you want to clone the repository.

Run the following command to clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository. You can find the repository URL on the GitHub page of your repository by clicking on the green "Code" button.

This will create a local copy of your repository on the USB stick.

When you are at school, follow these steps to interact with your repository:

Connect your USB stick to the school computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository on your USB stick.

From there, you can use standard Git commands such as git pull to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository, git add to stage your changes, git commit to commit your changes, and git push to push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

Make sure that you have the necessary permissions on the school computer to access and clone repositories from GitHub. You may need to configure your Git settings on the school computer if it's the first time you are using Git on that machine.

Regarding the SSH key, it is not specifically required for your USB stick. SSH keys are used for secure communication between your local machine and remote repositories, but they are not tied to any particular storage device like a USB stick. If you have already set up an SSH key for your GitHub account on your personal computer, you can use the same key when interacting with the repository from your USB stick.

However, keep in mind that the school computer might have its own restrictions and security policies. It's important to ensure that you have the necessary permissions and adhere to any guidelines or restrictions imposed by the school's IT department or network administrators.
